QUESTION:

For learning purposes can you help me with the following Project? Build a typing speed test that calculates words per minute (WPM) and accuracy. A fun project to practice DOM manipulation and working with timers.

Absolutely — here’s a solid “typing speed test” project you can build with plain HTML/CSS/JS. It will calculate WPM and accuracy, and it’s perfect practice for DOM manipulation + timers.

What you’ll build

A quote to type

A timer (e.g., 60 seconds)

Live stats:

WPM (words per minute)

Accuracy %

Characters typed / errors

Buttons: Start / Restart
